!! Travis Quick Start

If you are here, this is because you are bored of piece of tutorials trying to show you the way to make your project built by Travis when committing on Github. Or I just send you here from a *Pillar>https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar/*
tutorial.

Let's precise the context:

-You have a project on Github
-You want your project to be build by Travis when you commit
-You don't have a free Travis account

We are going to set a Travis account via a Github account, synchronize your Github projects with Travis. Finally we are going to activate Travis continuous integration on a Github project
and link Travis and Github via a token.


!!! Create a Travis account linked to your Github account

Go to the travis official website *www.travis-ci.org*.

You get something like the below scrennshot, it means you already have an account.

+Travis account>file://already.pillar+


You should get something like this

+Travis website>file://travis_website.pillar+.

In the top right corner of the page you have a ==Sign in with GitHub== button.

Just click on it and you should get a page asking you authorize the connection between Github and Travis.

+Travis ci authorization>file://authorize.png+

You can read before click ==Authorize travis-ci==. After that you are going to confirm by providing your Github username and password.


Few seconds after providing your Github credentials, you should get a page with your Github username with your names and a list of your Github projects.

+Travis profile>file://first_travis.png+

You can notice a ==Sync== button on the left top. Use it everytime you add or remove a project on Github and you want it to be updated on Travis.



!!! Activate Travis on your Github project

In the list of projects, just click on the switch button of the project you want.

+Activating Project>file://activated.png+

You have just activated Travis on that Github project. Then now when you commit on that project, Travis will try to build your project with the new commit.



!!! Token Generation

Often, Travis need to access to some project's files and do some actions with them. To achieve that, a link is created using a token. This token is generated by Github and added as an encrypted environment variable in Travis settings.

So go to your account settings (not a specific project settings) by clicking on a right top button ==Settings==.
+Account Settings Button>file://settings.png+

After that, click specifically on ==Developer Settings== in the left menu, for access to more advanced settings.

Just click on ==Personal Access Tokens== and you will get a page explaining what a token is and a button to generate a new token.
+Personal Access Tokens>file://tokens+

Click on ==Generate new token== button and choose the right you token needs. These rights depends on which work you have to do with that token.
But generally, ==repo== rights are good enough.
