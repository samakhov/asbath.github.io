<p>
I am a student in Computer Science, 3rd year at Lille University, Science and Technology Faculty. I love programming, and I am very interested by OOP aspects, design patterns, and mobile android programming.
I also participate to open source projects in the <a href="https://www.pharo.org">Pharo</a> community as Pillar, etc.
You ca find my <a href="CV-AsbathouBIYALOU-SAMA.pdf">CV</a> here.
I appreciate working with people. So if you are interested to work with me, contact me.

<li><a href="https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar">Pillar</a> : a Pharo tool used to generate documents in different formats Pdf, Html, Epub. With Pillar, we wrote a document one time in pillar syntax and generate as you want. It provides a list of mustache templates which can be used to design our documents.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

How to build a blog with PillarHere we are going to learn how to build a blog in Pillar. Building a blog consist of creating a website with articles (with possiblity of writing comments). So the most appropriate archetype for that purpose in Pillar is academic. We are goin to use a special annotation for getting blog files. The academic archetype propose a special template file for articles presentation containing a comment section.So, let's install academic first:$ pillar archetype academicA...<a href="blogs/building_blog.html">Read more</a>How to customize academic templatesWhile building website with Pillar using academic archetype, sometimes you may want to change some elements.

<h1>Books</h1>

<p>
Over the years I wrote the following books. I enjoyed it even if this is always more time consuming than what we would like. I also really have lot of fun writing columns because this is a completely different exercises than scientific papers.
